Create a function that receives an Integer and a String, the Integer being the life of a character
and the String its name. Call it "startCharacter". The function must return a String containing:
- If life is less than 20 points, then it should return: "Caution {Name}, you are under life"
- If the person is between 21 and 80, then they should return: "{Name}, you are a little hurt"
- If the person is over 81, then they should return: "{Name}, you are in perfect condition!
